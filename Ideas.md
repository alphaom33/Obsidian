	Dear diary, today I magiced

### Everas
Near the outskirts of Larsosheem
Grew with the city; Everas is largely unplanned, with roads everywhere in every direction, and there are no predefined sections
There is still, however, some organization.
Though most of the rich live in Larsosheem, and it feels as though the village’s wealthy are attempting to build their way there.

Distance from center of Everas to Larsosheem: 50 miles
Population: 750

People in Everas debate upon whether or not it should be a town. The official population specification is 1000, but Everas has existed for so long and is so developed that many claim it should qualify. Signs which point to ‘Village Everas’ are often graffitied.

The main material for roads is brick, which blends into dirt for smaller alleys
The village is not connected to Larsosheem by road, despite the town’s leadership having asked for years to have that fixed.
The main function to society is as a feeder for Larsosheemian mages, with an underground transport tunnel for that purpose. It is not safe for humans, but is still used as an excuse that Everian development has been supported.
