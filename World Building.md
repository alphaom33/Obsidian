#Yendorshone

## Yendorshone

Body and soul are in a parasitic relationship, the body granting magic for soul to consume, the soul slowly degrading the body.
	The body’s degradation allows for change and emotion, which would not otherwise be possible.
	The soul uses its body as a host also in reproduction, being born into the new child.
		Due to this, some lower class souls never even know that they and the body are separate beings.
		In this, Middle and Lower souls complete the only Draws of their life in order to create a new soul
			High Souls find disdain for them because of this

Souls can be stolen, leaving their bodies to endless repetition and nothingness.
	Some Soulless feel so devoid of emotion and excitement that they wander in hordes to find and consume it.
	Some wait, hoping endlessly that another’s soul will choose them.
	Some attempt to steal souls from Souled beings


Animals also possess this relationship
	Mages or Soulless can also consume an animal’s soul.

## Soul society
Souls are made for humans, shaped to envelop the host
	Roped, veiny appearance
	They begin as a four-legged squarish organism, like an infant Kangaroo
	First invasion occurs in the heart.
	In the youngest humans, a soul will only have infected one’s heart. Later humans are fully encompassed

Souls are organized in classes
	Upper class live in their own city, fed off of the wavering Wellspring. 
		They can be made of anything, the only requirement is impenetrability
	Middle class souls are created by humans
	The lowest class is created by animals

Soul class is determined by The Finders
	Finders are chosen by other Finders
	Finders leave no trace of their activities
	Finders are said to be silent, iron versions of souls
	The Finders are responsible for a soul’s education.
	These never take a soul from its body; even higher class souls must wait for their human to perish.
		Individuals sometimes subvert this, with great repercussions
		The best souls may attempt to get their body killed and enter society early.

### The Wellspring
All of High Soul society exists here; they cannot exist without Drawing from The Wellspring.
	Such Draws are strictly regulated, and any excess is punished by expulsion without question
	Not all High Souls are equally impermeable, yet each receives the same income.
	Excess Draw is used for currency, and magic

Their leader, the Yend, is chosen each month by competition each month
	The Yend from last month chooses the competition for the next month
		Because each Yend chooses their own best category, many can stay in power for quite a few years
	These competitions consist of anything, even everything, for which High Souls can compete.
	The competition applies to all souls, and even Middle Souls have won occasionally (though they were never informed)
	Taking the Yend title grants a soul connection with The Wellspring, and the knowledge which it posesses
		Even High Souls cannot contain this information, however, and most former Yends hold only faint shadows of what they knew

Each High Soul produces its own residence upon entry, with a budget of Draws to use for it
	High Souls can improve this place over their lifespan by spending further Draws
	Some spend countless hours and Draws making their buildings taller and taller, attempting to outshine everyone else
	After construction, a building is still subject to the laws of physics unless spells, constantly draining Draws, are placed upon it
		Most High Souls are exceptional architects because of this, and materials more advanced than humanity will ever know have been created to better produce housing
	Many choose a style familiar to them, making The Wellspring a clash of centuries and styles
	Architects some centuries ago wanted to create a new style for only the souls, and their insane creations still litter landscape

The Wellspring Wavers
	The highest class of High Souls is a carefully controlled population, fed by the Wellspring
	This Wellspring, however, appears to be running out, throwing society into a panic.
	Death is celebrated by all but the highest class, and many forms of suicide have now been introduced to the culture
		Duels for trivialities are common.
		High Souls burn themselves in Draws, releasing exceptional power for a brief instant before ceasing to exist
		Even ventures away from The Wellspring, once so decried, have become more celebrated
	
Typically, travel without a host heavily damages a soul, but transport vessels have been devised
	They utilize Draws stored in an body of some sort, with better bodies allowing for greater storage.
	Some plans have been drawn for ships which can travel the skies by using the combined storage of several human bodies, but even High Souls find this too cruel for now
	As with everything in High Soul society, vehicular expression has become a competition, and many discarded vehicles provide convenient shelter for local wildlife, if they can get over the stench of that vehicle’s decaying storage

### The Unending
Some souls, referred to as Unending, will find a new body after using up the old one

To gain a new host, they fight the old one
	Successful possessions will change a personality almost entirely
		This leads to the loose connection for which mages search
		A terrible mental toll is taken because of the fight, however, and many mages have problems because of it
	Unsuccessful possession will leave a damaged soul
		These are the Witches of Yendorshone
		Witches can also have powers, but theirs are typically odd, broken. Just like those holding them
		Many are immediately killed if the Unending fails, to prevent their powers from wreaking such harm upon the world

Time without a host damages them heavily, and many remember almost nothing of their previous bodies

Some High Souls have attempted becoming Unending in order to escape The Wellspring‘s waver, though it is frowned upon. Mostly Middle Souls attempt this, as they will die if without a host.

## Human Society
Humanity is ruled by the Orshone, who has been in power since before anyone can remember.
	He uses souls to prolong his life, consuming their energy by ways unknown to mortal men. 
	Several invasions have been launched against The Wellspring, but all have failed so miserably that all assume no more will come. 
		The Orshone, however, is simply biding his time, waiting for the right moment. 
		Noting The Wellspring’s current state, he might not have to wait for much longer.

Most humans exist within small villages, as larger ones attract Soulless. 

Many dislike the Orshone for stealing souls.
	Resistance forces have formed before, but none can stand against his raw power

### Cities
#### Larsosheem
Larsosheem  is the largest human city, and even the furthest villages have heard tales of its opulence
The Grand Elite Tower rises as highest among its buildings, a great tower dedicated to study, power, and the Orshone

### Religion
The most common religion in Yendorshone is Orshonism, worshiping the Orshone
	He is seen as a deity for bringing food and safety to his people seemingly since humanity’s inception
	His taking of souls is seen as judgement for poor behavior

The common symbol for Orshonism is a 

### Mages
Mages are able to subvert the relationship between body and soul due to the loose attachment which they possess
	By this subversion, they have the soul Draw power from something, usually animals, and utilize Drawn energy as magic
		Drawing can also be done to one’s own body, although this has obviously negative effects
	Most mages are made due to struggle with an Unending
	Some, however, are born with a loose attachment, and these are revered even more.

Mages require vast amounts of magic in order to work
	Some villages sacrifice plants, livestock, and people to feed the appetites of mages

Only a few mages are able to converse with their souls, most cannot even sense them
	Conversation is more common in the natural-born, and is one of the reasons for their higher status
	Those who can converse mark humanity’s only source of information about soul society, as The Wellspring is too dangerous for travel
	Sensing comes with experience, but conversation is almost always innate (though also attained by experience)
	The most powerful conversationists can entirely separate from their soul, while continuing to feed it.

Information about the truth of souls is heavily guarded, for fear by the souls of what an uproar it could produce
	Anyone sharing information is quickly discredited with lunacy, but killed quietly all the same
	Even incoming mages are told almost nothing, just that magic has entered them.

Mages form a connected, yet distant society
	Some train apprentices entirely on their own, though almost all of them hire help to find students
	These disconnected apprenticeships allows each to have their own teaching style, and to hide that style from other mages
	All mages dream of joining the Grand Elite, the only form of government which mages possess, and made up of its best members
	Only one connected mage school exists, overseen by the Grand Elite in Larsosheem

The Orshone is strangely tolerant of mage society, though he occasionally gives sudden and terrible judgements
	Many of the brightest mages over centuries have been quietly killed,
	The Orshone has kept this quiet from all but the Grand Elite, who live in constant fear of being too extraordinary for the Orshone’s tastes
		They always agree with his dictates because of this, and many see them as simply another arm of his forces

### Witches
Just as with mages, witches can be born innate, although this is much more rare
Witches are hunted by the rest of human society, and if it is discovered that one has been created, they are killed immediately
They are damaged even more than mages, for their very souls are coming apart

## Nonhuman hosts
Animals possess a fraction of a fraction of the energy a human does, meaning that everything must be conserved.
	Souls possessing an animal cannot think well, as that requires too much energy. Not many High Souls come from animal reproduction, and even fewer are actually discovered, as Finders often don’t bother to search.
		When a High Soul is discovered inside of an animal, however, the host is immediately killed, and the High Soul escorted to a new human host due to Finder Code 113, which states that only humans are sufficient for high Soul education.

Plants do not hold enough energy to sustain a soul,
	Some High Souls have made it a challenge to exist inside of plants, even modifying them to try it. Their failed attempts make up much of The Wellspring’s floral character.


##  Water
Yendorshone is the name of the world, but also its only continent, which is distinctive for the large body of water in its center known as The Eye.
	Land formations and other bodies of water drift off from it in a spiral pattern, almost as would a storm
	Water comes from and into The eye despite its being upriver of everything
	The Eye's water is almost unusually calm
	The Eye is a very common place for trade, with much profit

When interacting with the Outer Ocean, rivers from The Eye turn red and begin to boil, creating massive steam clouds along the coasts and giant waves.
	Because of this, very little travel occurs around the Outer Ocean
	Animal life there is uniquely adapted to the harsh conditions, and its status as a delicacy provides probably the only reason for traveling there
