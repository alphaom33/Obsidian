Gradient descent leads to the lowest-cost path, velocity ensuring relative maxima are overcome. This ensures that the scenario in which an n-dimensional hyperplane forms a saddle point does not result in failed training. Gathered data must be intaken by way of backpropagation, finding the partial derivatives of paths, forming them into useful information. Simple edge detection was the focus of early research, and can be determined by applying a Gaussian transformation to the vector of all pixels within an image.
The words formed sentences, the sentences paragraphs, but the paragraphs formed no meaning for me. Math was always my strongest point, but this was beyond me. I was the best programmer on my robotics team, but this programming was more than I could understand. I had wanted to begin learning about artificial intelligence because it had seemed interesting, even before the following year's ChatGPT, but the knowledge requirement was calc 5, and I had yet to know the first. I had always been the best, yet so incomprehensibly huge was the lack of my misunderstanding that I could not even imagine thinking of a world in which I thought that I could begin to know the topic. Yet, I yearned to.
