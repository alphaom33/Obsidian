System is based upon the manipulation of change, expressed by time

- Nature of Souls
- The [[World Building#The Unending]]

- Which Soul do you have?
- Fueling - called 'mana' for discreetness' sake

## Capabilities

> Please: Don't be like Harry Potter

### Manifestations
Increase rate of change in oneself
Desiccate a living thing
Could weaken a building's foundations to make it collapse
Revert the change induced by injury
Objects thrown sped up or stopped

### Limitations
Fuel is the largest limiter of power, both by intake and efficiency
Connection with the soul is a difficult one to overcome, requiring very careful practice and training
Skill, too, plays a role. 
To survive without a human, souls must lost their ability to utilize wellspring-style magic. Witches are not bound by this limitation
Because of that loss, they are now only able to interface with consumption and excretion by humans.

### Deep Magic
Because of her being a witch, Virda can interface with the world itself, using drawn magic as souls would in [[World Building#The Wellspring]]
