Nature of Souls
The Unending
The Grand Elite

Which Soul do you have?
Fueling
Soul Connection
Soul Mechanics
Specifics of certain magics

## Capabilities
Please: Don't be like Harry Potter
### Limitations
Fuel is the largest limiter of power, both by intake and efficiency
Connection with the soul is a difficult one to overcome, requiring very careful practice and training
Skill, too, plays a roll. 
To survive without a human, souls must lost their ability to utilize wellspring-style magic. Witches are not bound by this limitation
Because of that loss, they are now only able to interface with consumption and excretion by humans.

### Deep Magic
Because of her being a witch, Virda can interface with the world itself, using drawn magic as souls would in [[World Building#The Wellspring]]
