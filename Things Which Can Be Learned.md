## Capabilities

> Please: Don't be like Harry Potter

### Manifestations
Increase rate of change in oneself
Desiccate a living thing
Could weaken a building's foundations to make it collapse
Revert the change induced by injury
Objects thrown sped up or stopped

### Limitations
Fuel is the largest limiter of power, both by intake and efficiency
Connection with the soul is a difficult one to overcome, requiring very careful practice and training
Skill, too, plays a role. 
To survive without a human, souls must lost their ability to utilize wellspring-style magic. Witches are not bound by this limitation
Because of that loss, they are now only able to interface with consumption and excretion by humans.
Typically, each mage chooses an Aptitude by talent or desire to study more carefully. This aptitude will only focus on a specific element of magic, and results in the piece requiring much less fuel to utilize, such that it is actually viable for combat.

### Deep Magic
Because of her being a witch, Virda can interface with the world itself, using drawn magic as souls would in [[World Building#The Wellspring]]
