Obsessed with the sea
Came from [[World Building#Water]] The Eye, as a merchant's daughter
## Family Life
The Erlin family is not wealthy, but their ancestors were
The mother and father were married for business, as a joining of the once-great house Ershone and the rising Lulants
The father considers himself superior for being a born Ershone, the mother for her supposedly superior money-management skills
Many business ventures have been tried to raise them from middle class-ness, all of which failed
	The first and most hurtful was their dream venture of patterned sails for ships
		Kantiel was eight at the time, and constantly wanting to help, often getting in the way. Because of this, she has always felt responsible for the failure, and that she has not succeeded at anything definite since then helps cement the feeling
Due to all of their failures, The Erlins are exceptionally superstitious
	Kantiel was almost disowned outright when it was discovered that she possessed magic, and pushed to [[World Building#Larsosheem]] even though there was a workshop nearby
		Kantiel can't help but feel that she was pushed away because of the sail-patterned failure

## Character Motivations Or Whatever
Kantiel wishes for everybody to pursue their passions and find what they dream of, just as she has with leadership
Kantiel desperately wants to prove that she is intelligent an capable, sometimes past the point of politeness
She is very homesick for the sea, and emulates it at every opportunity
	Sometimes so homesick as to cry, although *never* in front of others

## Modern Existence
Arrived before anyone else at [[The Present Group (Working Title)]], which when combined with her natural skills in leadership, place the girl as leader easily.
Best friends with [[Tilian]], not despite but because Kantiel knows her friends' strengths and faults so well
She loves [[Magic Type Names#Retroaction]] best, but is naturally good at pretty much everything (besides [[Magic Type Names#Growth]]) because she practices so hard
