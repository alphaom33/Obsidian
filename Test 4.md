#calc2 
- [ ] Basically finding a geometric power series with a center at a different location and finding the interval of convergence (that’s the long problem)
- [ ] Using a binomial series to find the McLaren series for a certain function and writing the answer so many terms out (like three or four)
- [ ] finding center, vertices, foci, eccentricity of either an ellipse hyperbole parabola given an equation. You may have to put it into the correct form. 
- [ ] Another one might be just given an equation, you’d have to put it in the form or given specific points or a center and foci figure out how it opens so that you can write the proper equation for it. 
- [ ] Another is if you’re given a parametric on a certain interval, being able to sketch it so you will want to create a table with enough values on that interval and then writing the Cartesian equation
- [ ] if I give you parametric form to be able to convert it back to rectangular form (XY coordinates) and then being able to find the first and second derivative for something that’s in parametric form so you have to know that formula
