#Yendorshone
I died today. Just a little, I think. But it still hurt. The winter breeze was swirling around me as I walked along my family's field. I had recently returned from a town center meeting, and was wondering what to-  
Until I wasn’t. Until the world was flashing green and purple and blue and red, our field was swimming around me, and the trees all had on their widest grins.  
The world was blurry and dark when I woke, my thoughts unfocused and my emotions cold. Who were these insectile creatures chittering around me, too idiotic to know that I could kill them all effortlessly? Moving to do just that, I felt a soft hand upon my arm.  
"Don’t move, Virda," the voice was soft and feminine.  
"Virda, Virda had a great fall," came a smaller tongue.  
"Shhhh, little one. Your sister is still sleeping"  
"And I think we’ll have a better time putting her back together again," a man’s voice sounded from above.  
Memory sparked, then, and I realized that these voices were those of my own family. Why, then, did I feel so little towards them? They were sounding the same tones as usual, but instead of my typical quiet admiration for their character, I felt only annoyance that they were interrupting this room's silence. Then, looking inward at myself, I realized that everything hurt. My head, my back, even the ends of my hair were in pain. How does that make sense? What happened?  
"You can open your eyes now, Virda," my father never missed anything, and he had undoubtedly noticed my face crinkling in thought. There was no reason to continue sleeping, so I followed my father’s command.  
"Virda!" Iria excitedly exclaimed, throwing her little arms around me.  
"Careful, Iria," my mother touched her daughter’s shoulder lightly, but the girl just buried her head further into my shoulder. A stabbing pain, and I sat up sharply.  
"There she is," my father said, stepping further into the building, "Nice job, Lenelan. The best king’s men I’ve ever seen"  
"Would that make you the horses, then?" she asked, unable to restrain herself. The joke was good, and everyone else began chuckling. I didn’t laugh. Standing up slowly, I could still feel the dirt between my toes from walking in that field, and still taste the air from before my fall. I moved my eyes around the room, my home, and wondered what could possibly have happened. Noticing the confused glances I had been giving, my father said  
"One of the town boys - Jecketh, I think," his eyes twinkled at that "- saw your fall, and ran to tell us that you had been hit by an explosion. When we saw you just lying there, all quiet and still-  
"all like blegh and stuff," Iria helpfully noted. My mother’s smile faltered for a moment.  
"Well, I wasn’t scared, but Yoran probably was," she said, fighting against the expressions attempting to appear on her face. An explosion? I suppose that may explain the pain, I thought, but what about my mind?  
"We think you stepped on an old landmine from the war," my father had never seen fighting, but spoke about the Orshonian conquest with something nearing reverence. "You were lucky to have survived, much less to recover in only a few days"  
”I’m not sure ‘recover’ is the right word to use there,” my mother replied, "she must be in a lot of pain right now." My throat felt dusty and cold, and when I spoke, my voice sounded like a grain cart being transported to the capital.  
"Outside?" just a single word, but enough to make me gasp with pain.  
"Oh, sure, I suppose," my mother was thrown off-guard by the question, but still placed a hand on my back to help me rise, then looked to my father when I could not.  
"Sure, sure, Yoran always comes to save the day," he grumbled, but I saw a secret smile on his face at being able to help his eldest daughter.  
  
We all climbed the stairs together. up and out were my only thoughts as we limped outside, with my sister following energetically behind, escape must be mine.  
"Play! Play! Play!" she crowed, and I could tell that she had been left wanting for company during my long rest.  
We were not long up, however, when a dark man in a dark coat stood from the place where he had been standing, and walked over meaningfully. His hood was up despite the season, covering his face in shadow, and his hands were enveloped in black gloves. The only non-black color I could see on his entire figure was a pattern lightly stenciled on the coat, depicting a symbol of the Orshone. My mother’s whisper was too quiet for me to hear, but I caught its tone. The man’s being here was not good at all.  
"You’re lucky this village is so close to the capital, or I may have taken much longer to get here," he began.  
"Why are you here?" my father’s reply, so dark upon his typically cheerful face, surprised me. A glimmer of fear shone through my soul, the first emotion which I had held since awakening.  
"Well, that’s what I was about to tell you," he responded with a quiet chuckle. He was from the Grand Elite, he said, and he was very happy to see us.  
The Grand Elite was made up of the best mages from across Yendorshone, and operated within Grand Tower, of our capital city, Larsosheem. Tales of its decadence and power had permeated our town since I was a girl, made even stronger by our proximity, and its refusal to recognize our town, Everas, as anything more than a village. It was actually because of their need for organic matter that our town existed. What we produced was sent to them through an underground transport, Everas receiving supplies and protection in return.  
He said that a magical disturbance had been detected in the village, said that he had been sent to find who had caused it, said that I was about to become a very special girl.  
"What will this mean for us?" asked my mother, concern furrowing her brow.  
"Oh, we’ll have to see. I’ll complete an interview, and you’ll receive more information with the results," he replied. My mother’s face made it clear that she was not happy with this response, and neither was I. I had just woken up without any idea where I was in the middle of a conversation, been told that I had blown up, and now a mage wanted to talk with me? I still hadn’t even had a chance to talk about my lack of emotion, or what had happened in that field (it wasn’t a mine, I knew that for sure. No mortal weapon could inflict what I had experienced). The sliver of fear in my heart morphed into anger, growing teeth and biting down.  
"You've just walked into my town, right after I'm recovering from an injury, refused to listen to my parents, and are taking me to somewhere I don't even know! I'm not following you! I'm not doing anything until you tell me exactly what is going on here, and precisely the minutest detail of the unlikely scenario in which I actually follow you to whatever ridiculous place you're going and do whatever insane thing you want me to do!" My hands were balled up, shaking, and I was breathing hard. When was the last time I'd had an outburst that bad?  
"We’ll need to work on that control," the dark man said to me. "Can’t have you doing anything you would regret later." I followed him then, away from my family, my sister still wondering why we weren’t playing already, my mother and father looking on in anguish. I looked back and tried to smile, but my mouth wouldn’t form the expression. I settled for resolve instead.  
  
"Well isn’t this fun?" asked the dark man after coming to an empty crossway, flipping off his hood. A surprisingly youthful face greeted me under it, clean shaven and pale. His large forehead and ponderous eyes were accented by a shock of white hair which somehow fit him perfectly. The only thing which didn’t match, then, was his mouth. A small, cruel smile ran across it, smirking at one end when he delivered that 'joke.' He pulled out a clipboard, then simply let go of it. Yet instead of falling, it remained, floating in the air. For him it was a seemingly effortless action, but to me…  
The man has power, thought my cold, dead heart. power so that no one can do this to me ever again.  
"Right, first question," he began.  
"When you fell, what color did the sky turn?" Shock flowed through me. I had known that his presence had something to do with my fall, but that he knew so much was frightening.  
"I..." my throat was still dry from it. "Purple. Red. Green, I think?" He wrote something in his notebook, making a tsk sound as he did so. My already desiccated throat tightened.  
"Right, it will be easiest if we ask this one. Have you heard any voices in your head?"  
"No, I don't think so?" What were these questions? What was he trying to learn by them? What was I now? He made another mark in his notebook, this one with more force. Then, he leaned closer to me.  
"Have you experienced any... personality changes?"  
"Yes."  
He leaned in closer, breath smelling of slaughtered pigs and rancid herbs.  
"Describe them to me." I wasn't sure what to say. This man seemed so dark, would he find favor in my new state? Would anyone? lie, said my heart no one must know what you are. Scarcely knowing what I was doing, I parted my cracked lips  
"I feel... more outgoing (I had always been outgoing), and like I want to work more (another lie), and I feel more towards my sister (he can see right through you)." My hands were shaking, my face completely bloodless. His next mark on the paper was harsh, definitive. I had been caught. He knew what I was. The man slid one foot backwards on the bricks, making a harsh, sliding sound against the total quiet surrounding us. Then, he started grinning wildly.  
"Well, that's easy, then," he said. "We'll be making preparations for your trip now." My... what?  
"We'll provide clothes once you get there, but make sure you take a set for the road, and maybe some chickens so we can practice, " he said, with an uncharacteristically calm demeanor.  
"Where am I going?" He said a trip. To where? What about my family?  
"Well, to Larsosheem, of course. You're a mage," this new air was definitely quite different, but he fit into it just as well as the previous one. I couldn't even see the frown lines anymore, and even his clothing felt lighter, its pattern more pronounced. This man had changed his entire personality in a moment, like it was a hat he felt had gone out of fashion.  
"That's very lucky, you know," he said after I didn't answer. "Not many people get chosen by the magic"  
Was that what caused the vision which had assaulted me earlier? If so, I didn't feel especially lucky because of it. Still, the capital? To learn magic? I felt a glimmer of excitement, the first positive emotion since waking up.  
"Brilliant," I said.  
I never even considered how my family would feel about it.  
  
"No," he said.  
"She's not going," echoed my mother.  
"Well, you don't really have a choice. It is dictated by law," the dark man had come back out, his calmly uttered declarations a sharp contrast to my mother and father's highly emotional ones.  
"Virda has to stay here with me!" cried my sister, ever needy "so we can play house together again!"  
"We have her entire life to look towards, " my mother argued, "She can't simply leave it all behind"  
"Our love, our life, our happiness"  
"You can't simply take her away"  
"This is inane for even suggesting this!"  
"She cannot leave"  
"Virda is ours"  
"Forever"  
I tried to find some reason why I should care what these people felt, searching desperately for the remorse which I knew should be inside of me. But nothing came.  
When the dark man started walking away, I followed, leaving my family once again.  
This time, I didn't look back.
 
<p  style="text-align:center">◜⬘◞</p>
 
I had expected that the dark man would have come through some magical means, and was mentally preparing myself to be teleported or flown or however mages travel'd fifty miles to the capital. I was rather surprised, therefore, when after reaching the boundary of Everas, we simply kept walking. When I asked him why, the man simply mumbled something about insufficient local animal stores and continued walking.
How does he change so often? I thought to myself. Is he controlling it?
Due to my family's argument, I hadn't had time to grab the clothes and food my guide what is his name? had required. Would we stop somewhere to get things? Walk until I starved? My earlier resolution to not have anyone control me was fading. I wondered how long it would take for me to have that level of power.
I hadn't seen anyone traveling near us since leaving town. That likely wasn't unusual, Larsosheem still hadn't built a human-accessible pathway to Everas, but my sliver of fear was made stronger by that fact, despite everything I attempted to fight it with.
"You're shaking again," happy face this time, "what's wrong?"
This is my chance to actually get answers, I thought.
"I never grabbed the things you told me to. What are we going to do?" I began.
"Oh, that?" he asked, "Don't worry. I have extras, and this trip should only take us a week or two."
two weeks? Growing up in the town, I had never even spent two days encamped, and now we were to go for a week? Those packs weren't very large. Could they really hold everything we needed? What sort of extras did he mean? Wasn't he feet taller than me? Was I going to have to live as a scavenger for so long? Were we just going to die out here? Laughter was his answer to my paling face, and he said
"That look was beautiful. We should get there by the end of tomorrow, provided you can keep this pace (I bristled at that), and I grabbed your things for you."
For me? I had seen his casual use of power before, but he had never left my sight while we were walking; he couldn't have gotten them by natural means. I truly require use of these abilities, I observed.
"Come, you have more questions, yes?" Happy face truly was so different from his counterpart.
"What's your name?" I asked pensively.
"Ivmoshk," he replied. A good start.
"What is magic like?" Instantly, his expression slammed closed.
"None of your business," dark face replied. I sighed and continued walking.
Ivmoshk stayed dark face as we stopped for the night, and set up camp himself. He didn't even use magic this time, and I just stood there, watching him create a small shelter for half an hour. When it was finished, he immediately went to sleep, with no further explanations. Am I supposed to sleep in the same place as him? I shuddered at the thought. But there was no other shelter, and I was exhausted from our full day of travel. Speaking of which, where were my things? Ivmoshk said that he had grabbed them for me, so I went looking for them in his bags.
They were piled, almost carelessly next to the shelter, almost looking for someone to steal them. The bags themselves were more mundane than I would have expected for such a wizard, bar one so filled with lettering and iconography that I could not even make out its original color. This I was also unable to open, though now that I was so close, what was that smell? Why was the scent of rotting chickens emanating from this bag? Anyway, I found nothing unusual in the others, and my promised supplies were all there. I ate bread and uncooked potatoes because there was no fire, then swallowed my revulsion and went to sleep by Ivmoshk.
I had heard a hundred stories about the Larsosheem and its Grand Tower, the architecture and culture of the city contrasting with the cold opulence of its crowning jewel. Seeing it, however, was something else entirely. When Grand Tower crested over the horizon, I thought it seemed quite impressive, and a rather extraordinary work of architecture. Then, it kept going. As we walked, it grew higher and higher over the horizon line, jutting upwards into the sky with a magnificence I could never have dreamed of. And the capital itself wasn't even in view yet. Happy face was here now, but I couldn't take my eyes Grand Tower for even the second it would take to gather more knowledge from him. I stopped walking, content simply to bask in the glorious construction before me. I hadn't thought myself able to feel such wonder after what happened, but evidently, such world shattering constructions could break into even my heart. I continued staring at the tower.
"Beautiful, isn't she?" Ivmoshk broke my reverie, "Just imagine how much better it will be when you're inside, studying with all the others who have been chosen."
The mention of others gave me a start. What would they be like? What kinds of people were chosen by magic? Would they be like me? No, said my heart, no one is like you
"How many people will there be?" I asked to break the sudden silence.
"About one hundred," he replied, "not everyone gets to study at the Grand Tower; you're actually quite special."
"What will we be studying?" I asked, the logical next question. Again, his expression became closed. Why does he shut off every time I ask about magic? What is happening with him?
"Where are we going? What is happening? Why so many questions?" his voice was mocking. "You'll see soon enough, little mage. We're almost there."
Indeed we were. As Ivmoshk was berating me, the city itself came into view, and I was surprised once again. After the tower, I had expected a city almost as opulent. Instead, it was practically in ruins. Large, swaying wooden constructions dominated the skyline, their smaller counterparts cast in such shadow that they were almost invisible next to the Grand Tower. As we got closer, the stench hit me first. It smelt as though there were several forests' worth of decaying trees and animals, enough that I started looking around for a source for whatever catastrophe had occurred here. Ivmoshk chuckled darkly at my wrinkled nose, commenting on the endless wonders of Larsosheem. You get used to it after a while, he said. I wasn't sure I ever would.
Then, came the voices. A roar like that of the wind in a gale washed over my ears, engulfing me in a sound I could not have imagined previously. Where was I in such a roar? What could exist in this torrentuous outpouring of humanity, maintain existence while attacked from so many fronts. I braced myself against it and continued walking, Ivmoshk saying nothing to my quivering features. The city had no wall, so we walked right into bedlam, navigating through shoving crowds and hawking merchants to our destination. Or, rather, Ivmoshk walked to the Grand Tower. I was instead captured in the crush of population while dark face walked away, either not knowing or not caring that I had been left behind.
"No!" I cried, but my voice was weak in this overwhelming tide, and I was swept away from my only anchor.
Once Ivmoshk was gone, the population of Larsosheem was free to do with me as they wished. A man missing half his fingers shoved a goblet into my mouth, only five, four for this packet of teeth, whoops almost fell, three for a ring, ten to the eye says the man with a patch, seven a drink for the couple what could he mean who's that he's gone, twenty for a room that sounds nice where's my money, where are my clothes, how's my food is everything gone? Like that and it's vanished, a dark chuckle near my ear I turn he isn't there the voices now they rise they fall I'm finished it's gone it's worthless I'm worthless how has this occurred I must escape there's no escape I can't go on I can't give up please just let me go! The tower I can't see it's so hard to move I'm being crushed I can't breathe wait is that let me out out out!
I collapsed, finally, into a deserted alleyway, sobbing. My relief and shame, then, were so great that I never even considered why this out of all the alleys was void of those endless crowds. Why had I let him get away? The once impressive Grand Tower had fallen before lower Larsosheem's might, and I had been unable to even see it with so many people around, let alone travel towards the thing. I was now without money, food, or spare clothing in a city designed to eat me alive, with no hope of reaching shelter, and only this alley to keep me company. Was I truly destined to die here, simply because of a second's lapse?
"Don't worry dearest, you won't die while I'm here," the voice sounded like brittle, now breaking bones, their dust rattling over stairs, doors, and alleyways to seat itself within my frozen ears. A woman ancient as the stones on which she stood was in front of me, wrinkled, gaping maw opening towards me, swallowing me whole. Where can I find light in a land with no stars its consuming me I can't-
No, don't panic. It's fine. You're fine. Everything's fine.
"Oh, and you'll find me fine as well, mageling," she cackled at that word, though I couldn't tell why, "I've come to give you a message." A message? And was she reading my thoughts as they ran through my head? How?
"We'll leave that up to speculation, shan't we," she cackled again. Leaning in close now,
"I know you. I know your very soul. I've come to say that you are not like those you have come to meet. That they are the greatest danger in this world to your existence. That if I were you, I think it would be best to," the face moved to fill my entire field of vision, voice dropping to an almost soundless, endlessly hoarse whisper, "RUN!" She stepped back, nodded, then melted into the crowd.
Right, that just happened, the crush was starting towards me with her gone, so I didn't have time to dwell on what she had said. Her manner of speaking outside the box, however, had given the idea for a new plan: escape to the rooftops and figure out what to do after that.
That in mind, I started looking for ways up. The drainpipe was too thin, that window too narrow... there! An exhausted, rusty ladder leaning on the building for who knows what reason. The citizens of Larsosheem were getting quite close, however, so I started a dead sprint towards it. In Everas, I had never been the best runner, always caring more about what others thought of me than how quickly I could make it to some particular tree, but now, I would have made even Jecketh proud. leaping onto the second rung, I scrambled upwards before the faceless mass could attempt my capture once again, barely making it to the top before someone picked up the ladder and simply started walking away. I could have died there and he... maybe he wants it for money or something? But why...I didn't think I would ever get used to this city.
Looking around, I could once more see the Grand Tower, and was once more astonished by its contrast with everything around me. What must happen to a city for the disparity to be so high? Even more surprisingly, I felt elation shining within me. I had braved the depths of the most terrible, tempestuous ocean ever known, and survived, well, slightly scathed, but survived nonetheless. Now, to find shelter and escape this freezing cold. The buildings in this section seemed stronger, and better organized than others. Lucky that, I thought, or I'd have fallen into someone's living room and been doubly in a mess. In any case, they were close enough that I could simply walk along their roofs. The first was easy enough, and the second like it. The third quickly fell to my prowess, and I was beginning to feel quite confident. Then came the fourth.
I saw it when dropping from the last building, that my only path forward looked to be ten feet in length, with only crowd beneath. I thought that a jump between them might be possible, would definitely be possible if I could run like earlier. It had to be done. Readying myself, I placed one foot, now somehow shoeless, in front, and one behind. I thought of the way in which Jecketh would always do this, adjusting my crouch to hopefully be more like his. It still felt awkward, unbalanced, and weak, but I had no other option. Slowly, I tested my right leg and then my left. Now for force. In one smooth motion, I pushed with every muscle in my body out of the crouch and into a sprint past the chimneys over the bricks, leaning into the leap I pushed with one foot on the edge of the world and
"Hey! What are you doing!" My body seemed to hang there for a moment, suspended over that ever-hated sea. Then, it was rushing up to meet me. A few seemed to stop and try backing away, but I couldn't tell with how fast everything was moving. The sky seemed so still up there, so peaceful. So different from all the chaos down here. I tried to remember the sky as I fell, as I... Why had I not hit the ground yet? I opened my eyes, and saw several men standing on the rooftop, frowning at me very intently. One whom was Ivmoshk, dark face ready and growling. 
<p  style="text-align:center">◜⬘◞</p>
"You, girl, are exceptionally stupid," Ivmoshk said.
