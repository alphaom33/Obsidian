Ivmoshk, 60 (but magically younger)

Ivmoshk's Possession was an exceptionally messy one, leaving his old soul still partially intact.

Ivmoshk was very powerful as a result of this, but his mental state became so ruined by the fact that each half of his soul thought the other terrible at everything, that he never actually got anywhere with that power.

Such unrealized potential destroyed Ivmoshk's cheerily ambitious first self, which now comes out only very rarely. The second blames first for it, and everyone around Ivmoshk. He was assigned to be a first-stage trainer and recruiter, because he was not enough for anything else.

Ivmoshk's second self is unhealthily mean and disparaging. The first is shy but acts magnanimous. Can't be out for more than a few minutes without falling apart. In his current position, second doesn't want to bother with teaching, so forces first to do it, instead. First cannot show it or he knows that second will steal his joy, but he loves teaching more than anything else in the world.
