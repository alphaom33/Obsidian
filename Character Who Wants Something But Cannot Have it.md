Sound. The simplest thing, yet even that is altered here. I can hear the cries of my fellows, fallen far from me, yet where and what are absent, garbled cries only reaching my ears. Sight. I can see less than five meters ahead, dark smoke from the vessel filling my vision, stinging and stripping my eyes, forcing them closed against such force. And so I thrash, blind and deaf, tossed unrelentingly by forces more powerful than I could have imagined. A burning has begun in my chest. It won’t be long now. Yet still I struggle against the monstrous impossibility before me. Everywhere I look is down, everywhere I fall is up, yet still I cannot succumb. The other’s have stopped screaming, wanting, hoping: my voice alone resounds. The darkness surrounding feels greater and greater before my stoppered eyes.
I can feel my legs weakening under the pressure of the deep, my fight bringing only pain to them. Would it not be better to die in peace, rather than strive for hopeless escape? Yet still, I cannot relent. Those who put me here must see, those who loved me must know that I survived. The darkness ever looms. Sound ever lessens. Yet still, I struggle.
