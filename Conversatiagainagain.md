He opened the door, gestured frantically that I should enter. Inside lay a small, darkened dormitory. Their eyes greeted me first, one pair wide, one green, one shut. Wide-eye's attached body was tall, with brown hair and a remarkably elven expression. Green was rather shorter than Wide-eye, and somewhat more plump as well. She was currently attempting to rectify Shut's being asleep.
"Nsoris. Now." Her voice was sharp against night's silence, too high and cheery for how tired I felt.
"I don't want to," she complained.
I jumped at the hand on my back. Cowly. I'd forgotten he was there, for a moment. His gestures were even more energetic now, and his face was quite expectant. *Fine*, I thought, opened the door, and stepped over its threshold. Immediately, it was shut behind me, loud enough that even Shut left the land of dreams to glance at me.
"Don't knock the house down," she said, in a voice much more composed than I would have expected for someone who had been conscious for barely three seconds.
"I&mdash;"
"Oh, don't mind Nsoris there," Green said sweetly, "She's still adjusting to... y'know... being a human and all that."
"You&mdash;" Nsoris sprang from her bed like a tiger pouncing on a small, dirty rat. Her lithe movements seemed almost inhumanly dangerous, and Green's eyes went larger than those of Wide. In a second the girl had gone from insignificant layabout to predator circling, circling Green, ready to dart in at any moment and&mdash;
"Ouch," she groaned, from the floor, where she had fallen, over her very own feet. Green immediately starting guffawing as though her epitaph hadn't already appeared inscribed a single moment ago, Wide's demeanor dropped for a quick chuckle, and even I couldn't suppress a smile at the girl's juxtaposition.
"As I said, adjusting to humanity," Green said confidently.
"Tillian, leave off," said Wide-eye. "Nsoris, are you alright?" The girl only growled from her place on the floor. Their three bunks lay in front of me in a small alcove, and the girls were standing in that little empty space between them. Kantiel straightened from where she was leaning over Nsoris, and walked over to me with the slightest swagger in her step.
"Sorry for that," she said, that elven expression creasing her face until I felt as though I was slowly suffocating under its power. "I'm called Kantiel," she said. "What can we call you?"
"It's... I'm..." Against that face, I felt the world revolving, turning, cartwheeling around me. The word felt cold on tongue, came sluggishly through my lips. "Virda."
"Virda," Green tested the name, tasted and spat it out. Nsoris was still just lying on the ground, appearing peaceful but for the fists tightly clenched at her sides.
She spoke without opening her eyes. "Nsoris." Then, pointing to Green, "Tillian." *I liked my name for her better*
"How did you even know where I was standing?" Tillian asked.
"With my ears, dimwit," responded Nsoris.
Kantiel turned towards me again, still wearing that ethereal expression, and asked "from where have you come?"
"Watch out, she's started the list," Nsoris whispered loudly, "they get more difficult the longer you go on."
"I&mdash; I don't think I have a list?" The Expression dropped from her face, and I felt my heart wrench. What was it about this girl?
"Place of origin, occupation, mother's occupation, siblings, friends, father's occupation, leader, goals, manner of change," she replied.
"Fine, then," she said. "Why don't you do it this time?" The girl with the face from another world sniffed, raising her chin in an overly haughty way.
"No. Tillian?"
"Of course," said Tillian. "Now, where are you from?" Even I joined the laughter at that.
