He opened the door, gesturing frantically that I should enter. Glancing through the door, I saw three beds to my right, positioned along the walls of a small alcove, and girls to match. Their eyes greeted me first, one pair wide, one green, one shut. Wide-eye's attached body was tall, with brown hair and a remarkably elven expression. Green was rather shorter than Wide-eye, and somewhat more plump as well. She was currently attempting to rectify Shut's being asleep.
"Nsoris. Now." Her voice was sharp against night's silence, too high and cheery for how tired I felt.
"I don't want to," she complained.
I jumped at the hand on my back. Cowly. I'd forgotten he was there, for a moment. His gestures were even more energetic now, and his face was quite expectant. *Fine*, I thought, opened the door, and stepped over its threshold. Immediately, it was closed behind me, loud enough that even Shut left the land of dreams to glance at me.
"Don't knock the house down," she said, in a voice much more composed than I would have expected for someone who had been conscious for barely three seconds.
"I&mdash;"
"Oh, don't mind Nsoris there," Green said sweetly, "She's still adjusting to... y'know... being a human and all that."
"You&mdash;" Nsoris sprang from her bed like a tiger pouncing on a small, dirty rat. Her lithe movements seemed almost inhumanly dangerous, and Green's eyes went larger than those of Wide. In a second the girl had gone from insignificant layabout to predator circling, circling Green, ready to dart in at any moment and&mdash;
"Ouch," she groaned, from the floor, where she had fallen, over her very own feet. Green immediately starting guffawing as though her epitaph hadn't already appeared inscribed a single moment ago, Wide's demeanor dropped for a quick chuckle, and even I couldn't suppress a smile at the girl's juxtaposition.
"As I said, adjusting to humanity," Green said confidently.
"Tillian, leave off," said Wide-eye. "Nsoris, are you alright?" But the girl only growled from her place on the floor. Kantiel straightened from where she was leaning over Nsoris, and walked over to me with the slightest swagger in her step.
"Sorry for that," she said, that elven expression creasing her face until I felt as though I was slowly suffocating under its power. "I'm called Kantiel," she said. "What can we call you?"
"It's... I'm..." My mouth felt dry, my tongue cold. "Virda."
"Virda," Green tested the name, tasted and spat it out. 
Nsoris, still just lying on the ground, pointed to herself and spoke without opening her eyes. "Nsoris." Then, pointing to Green, "Tillian." *I liked my name for her better*.
"How did you even know where I was standing?" Tillian asked.
"With my ears, dimwit," responded Nsoris.
Kantiel turned towards me again, still wearing that ethereal expression, and asked "from where have you come?"
"Watch out, she's started the list," Nsoris whispered loudly, "they get more difficult the longer you go on."
"I&mdash; I don't think I have a list?"
"Place of origin, occupation, mother's occupation, siblings, friends, father's occupation, leader, goals, manner of change," she replied.
"Fine, then," she said. "Why don't you do it this time?" The girl with the face from another world sniffed, raising her chin in an overly haughty way.
"No. Tillian?"
"Of course," said Tillian. "Now, where are you from?" They started laughing, and I attempted - awkwardly - to join them.
"I... it's...(why are you pausing so much?) a small village outside of Larsosheem. A mage feeder, though they hated that. I&mdash; I'm apparently a mage now, though, so..."
"Oh, right! We're supposed to tell you how this will work," Kantiel jumped in. "You'll begin instruction tomorrow after the second bell, just follow us to the room."
"You aren't yet advanced enough to actually take lessons with us, though, so you'll be with a beginner's instructor." Tillian.
"Can you feel her energy, though? She's going to make it past initial lessons quite quickly," complimented Nsoris, finally getting up from the floor.
"Yes. And you can feel that from the ground?" asked Tillian dubiously.
"Anyway, would you happen to know what these lessons would be about?" I was beginning to get frustrated at their constant bickering.
"Oh, yes," responded Kantiel. "We'll be exploring the contents of your soul in order to determine what kind of mage you are," *What? I&mdash; I needed my soul to stay mine. What had that woman said? My parents had always talked about how you should never let anyone... What was I doing here?* A thump as I stepped backwards into the wall. *Hide, run and hide!* cried my heart, beating ever faster. *They didn't look concerned? Why weren't they concerned? We were in trapped a facility ruled by mages from which we could not escape and in that inescapable place we were forced to reveal the contents of our very souls? What would that even look like? Why weren't they scared?*
"It does sound like a lot, doesn't it?" asked Nsoris, seeing the reaction on my face. "We were all a bit scared at first."
"I wasn't," sniped Tillian.
"It seems miniscule in the ocean's face to me," reposted Kantiel. Nsoris sighed.
"I'm not just letting them look at my soul! I can't just..." I was shaken at how normally they were still all treating this. Had *Tillian* truly not been scared? What had happened to these people to make them think that the breaking of a soul's isolation was trivial? And they had implied that was only the first part!
"I can't just let everyone see into my soul. That's not how... I need to get out of here!" My breath was coming faster and faster now, my face growing ever colder. I tried to get my bearings in the darkened room, looked right, left, but couldn't see a thing. I turned uncaring and immediately ran into a table. My shin exploded with pain as I fell onto a chair, then the ground. I didn't even stop to contemplate the indignity, just crawled over to the wall where I frantically searched for a door, a window, a vent, anything which would let me escape from this awful house of madness. Yet it was entirely smooth. My hands found nothing but despair, my eyes nothing but shame. Kantiel was standing above me. *Kantiel, a perpetrator of this insanity!* My veins pulsed, stretching as if they were about to explode. She slowly moved her hand towards my shoulder. *Like I'm some wounded animal,* I thought.
"Virda." She spoke quietly but forcefully. "You're okay. No one is going to examine your soul tonight, and we can figure out what to do in the morning."
"But what if it's too late then? What if they force me? What if&mdash;"
Nsoris now stood above me, too. I felt like a child, crouching as my shin throbbed under their soft gazes. "Why do you care so much about not letting them look?"
"I can't just let. It's mine!" I glanced around again, looking for any exit at all. I couldn't calm down. My breath sounded forced and shallow. "I have to find a way out; I can't see..."
Nsoris grabbed my chin. "This is a new place, and you're scared. But you must understand that if every other person to pass through these halls has had an examination as well. That the examinations were put in place to *help* you. That there is no danger posed." Maybe... maybe she was right? But why did it feel so viscerally unnatural? Why was I shivering at the very thought of having my soul observed. My shin was still in pain. I looked at the table which I'd fallen over. It was fairly low, round with four legs, and had stools surrounding it. There was a small cloth in the center. Blue, it seemed, with an embroidered pattern. It was covered in scratches and... I grabbed my thoughts, forcing them to be calm and focused.
She stood back up. "Sorry for grabbing you. I can't..." She curled and uncurled her fingers helplessly. *I* can *do this*, I thought. I forcibly controlled way my lungs were moving oxygen. *It shouldn't be odd. They think it's normal. I should be able to follow suit*. I ignored the way my heart trembled at that thought.
"No, I think it helped," said Kantiel. "Look at her." I couldn't stand being discussed like I was a small animal anymore, so I stood up suddenly. *I can't believe what a scene that was*, I thought. *Falling over a table?*
"Sorry." I began. "It... it makes sense. You're right. What else do you have to say?"
"Oh my goodness is the crazy girl back to normal finally?" Called Tillian, still over by the beds.
"You're an idiot," responded Nsoris. For once, I didn't care about their argument. It was fine. I was normal. I just had to ignore how wrong everything about this was.
Kantiel side-eyed Tillian, then looked back at me, speaking in a normal conversation tone again. "After your examination, you'll be brought through basic magical training until you pass the test, and then you'll be ready to join us."
"Despite what Tillian would have you believe, our training isn't really that advanced yet. You'll catch up before too long. Even Kantiel has only been here for maybe a month." Said Nsoris.
"Yeah, maybe *your* classes aren't that advanced," countered Tillian. Nsoris looked as though that one had actually gotten to her.
"Okay," I said, moving past the two and back towards the beds. Thankfully, it seemed as though my little stunt hadn't hurt anything major, although my left shin still hurt a bit. *Imagine if I was the girl who couldn't walk, too*, I thought.%%This is just a really long middle tag shut up%% "What am I going to do for tonight?"
"Oh, right!" Said Kantiel. "There *are* only three bunks." Well, I'd more been asking about everything else, but yeah, that was my question.
"Either you sleep in a bunk with one of us, or I can make Nsoris go with Tillian," Kantiel continued. The aforementioned bedmates of possibility started gagging simultaneously.
I glanced over at them. "Maybe... could I just sleep in yours?"
"Sure," I looked, but couldn't read what she had thought of that. Stupid darkness. "I'll take the lower berth. You two, fall to rest." Surprisingly, they actually complied, leaving the three bunked in what must have been record time.
"Go on. We'll find you more clothes and things tomorrow. For now just let it all go..." She exhaled, looked exceptionally comfortable in her place, and I found myself wishing *I* could sleep that easily. *Well, nothing left to do now,* I thought. The ladder was creaky, the bed hard, the sheets cold. Even bearing these, I found myself falling away almost immediately.
Thus ended my first day at the tower of the Grand Elite.
