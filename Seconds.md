Open into the bustle of modern life with a car crash. Surroundings should suggest a futuristic tone, without being overly ostentatious. Follow pedestrians stepping around, with conversations at a roar. Slip into a building and increase volume further, then slide whip pan into a family, a business, a store, a government office, becoming a blur. A light source is visible through the montage, slowly moving in an arc from the screen's left to its right as conversation's volume, ever-increasing, draws near what seems beyond safe range of human hearing, until its arc is completed, day turns to night, and all voices instantly fall dead. Motion slides to a stop, arriving pointed towards the lightless sky, with no sound beyond hushed city ambience.
Clicking footsteps,  growing nearer and nearer.
A foot, clawed and furred, steps into frame facing towards the camera. Slowly, it pans along a body covered in mutations, though it still highly resembles a humanoid structure. The face is largely covered by a large, muzzle-like metal mask, with horns like bull's horns jutting out of it. The face above is strangely human, wearing a concerned expression.

THE ALLEYWAY

<div style="text-align:center">The Ox</div>
"What are you doing down there, Botticelli?
Camera cuts to over The Ox's shoulder, revealing a smallish boy lying on the ground with dirty clothing, cloth mask, and affect expression. Camera cuts to the opposite person's shoulder every time speaker changes.

<div style="text-align:center">Botticelli</div>
"Fell. Running too hard.

<div style="text-align:center">The Ox</div>
"You *were* supposed to be carrying messages.

<div style="text-align:center">Botticelli</div>
"I know. There were so many people and streets and they were so loud and...

<div style="text-align:center">The Ox</div>
(Sigh)
"It's fine. Just remember what we have to do tonight. You shouldn't be given any other tasks, so let's find a spot together and you can calm down.

The camera zooms out and behind, as The Ox bends his massive bulk down to help up the boy, then pans up to follow them walking away while slowly fading to a sword being rubbed across a grindstone. The scene snaps into foreground as that grindstone suddenly ceases turning, the sword is removed, and another replaces it. The grindstone begins again.

THE GRINDSTONE

<div style="text-align:center">Bored Man</div>
"Is that the last of them?
The camera looks over to a man sitting on a chair in the corner of an office space, and zooms out slightly to keep the grindstone in view. Their room is very normal and cheery other than the grindstone and swords in its center. The man is wearing a very noticeably floral shirt.

Hinata looks pointedly at the pile of unsharpened swords, then continues his work.

<div style="text-align:center">Bored Man</div>
"I just don't see why you have to sharpen a bunch of swords nobody is going to use. The party's starting, man. The crew's waiting. Let's join in.

<div style="text-align:center">Hinata</div>
(glaring from the side)
"*Don't* call it a party.
Another sword is placed along a row, another sword is grabbed from the pile.

<div style="text-align:center">Bored Man</div>
"I just feel like-

<div style="text-align:center">Hinata</div>
(Low and dangerous)
"If you don't get out right now, I will run you through where you stand.

<div style="text-align:center">Bored Man</div>
"Whatever, man. Just don't make us wait for too long.
After the Bored Man exits, Hinata sniffs with equal parts superiority and morosity, removes a sword, and replaces it.


THE ARENA
Cut to a wide, two-lane street with building placement indicating that they are near the edge of town. Botticelli and The Ox have set up chairs on a sidewalk, next to stairs for a balcony. The eery quiet is broken by distant, throbbing music and light from a nearby building. The Ox appears comfortable with the silence, while Botticelli fidgets, glancing towards the music's origin every couple of seconds. No one else is present.
The camera is looking in the same direction as The Ox and Botticelli, and from that direction, footsteps can be heard through the fog.
Emerging comes a line, marching in sync, each wearing a sword at the hip and outfits inspired by the Tattsuke-Bakama. A man in similar garb but for a very floral shirt is visible just to the right of center.
They stop, grunt, and unsheathe their swords in sync. Each one slides out perfectly.
The Ox gets up from his chair, presses a button on his mask, and starts walking towards the new arrivals. As he does so, he is joined at various intervals by several unique fellows. None are inhuman as The Ox, but all have unique masks, clothing styles, and mannerisms. They emerge from alleys, houses, windows, and mostly where the music came from. All are screaming under their masks. A line is assembled, they beat their chests, and roar.
The two each form one half of a circle, with Hinata and The Ox walking to its center. The camera is angled such that Botticelli can be seen leaning over a nearby balcony intently.
Cut to the center, facing the two at eye level. Hinata finally unsheathes his beautifully designed sword as The Ox points his grotesque claws against it. They circle one another while speaking, camera retaining the perpendicular angle.

<div style="text-align:center">Hinata</div>
"You have come too far this time, foul Ox.

<div style="text-align:center">The Ox</div>
(chuckle)
"Hinata, you ever inspire me. How one man can be so totally pharisaical is frankly astounding. That robbery was ours to make. The lines are clear. You are at fault.

<div style="text-align:center">Hinata</div>
"The vehicle would not have traveled through your territory would it not have been for your machinations to reroute it. I've been losing men for weeks due to these clear violations of the contract.

<div style="text-align:center">The Ox</div>
"Hmp. Likely enough. (muttering) having to pay your men so they don't run away...

<div style="text-align:center">Hinata</div>
"At least I don't have to ask mine if they'll pretty please let off their drugs for a couple seconds and go on a job with me. At least I can trust mine not to betray me at a moment's notice. (voice raised, looking around pointedly) at least I don't have to wonder whether my best man is *even going to show up!*

<div style="text-align:center">The Ox</div>
"Oh, don't worry about Dragon's Breathe. I decided that, just once more, *I* would be taking this fight.

a momentary expression of fear crosses Hinata's face, quashed immediately.

<div style="text-align:center">Hinata</div>
"Well, then. Let us begin. A contest of champions?

<div style="text-align:center">The Ox</div>
"You always ask.

The circle of members draw inward as The Ox goes for a first blow, astonishingly fast despite his bulk, and Hinata blocks, spinning his sword around to block the second fist aimed at him, then bending low for a kick. The Ox's leg becomes like jelly against Hinata's attack, then reforms upon his exit. Hinata sighs, then resets his stance.
