Remember that these numbers are loose, and simply used to ensure that something like the thousand-year stalactite doesn't happen again

## Fuel
Living things are ab%%thanks, Evelyn%% 2* dead, but obviously more difficult to carry, and can be Drawn for 1/2 period before decomposing
The first is total mana content, the second for how long it can be drawn continuously without decomposing. These numbers also indicate the speed at which mana can be drawn, more time indicating a slower draw
Chicken - 100, 4 minutes
	most common mana source, good all-around, with pretty good improvising capabilities
	Standard mana pouch is sized for these, and other numbers are based on what can fit inside of that pouch
Grain - 100, 2 minutes
	specialized for use on living creatures
Insects - 200, 10 seconds
	Often used as a last resort. Assists with self-action
Cow - 500, 10 minutes
	good for a slower fighting style, helps plant capabilities.
## Average Mage
Mages tend to specialize, and these descriptions are for specialized skills.
Healing
	Scrape will be instant. 10
	Broken bones must be done with precision, but the raw magic is about twenty seconds. 30
	Regrowing a limb could take hours. - 300
Rolling/Speed
	can do twice speed per pound easily - 10
	thrice with effort - 30
Crushing 
	import wear upon objects. Focus on strength rather than precision, which is why it can do a year per second %%the fact I even wrote this justification tells me everything I should need to know about this one's plausibility. Maybe I can just rule of cool it?%% - 5/s
Mind - quintuple rate. Quite difficult to master, but very prized by The Orshone. His special methods can wring a person of life within days, but bring so much innovation that many believe the tradeoff to be worth it. - tracked by the outside world's perception of time 25/s
Teleportation abilities (most chagne how an object passes through time. This teleports it into or from a different time) - I specifically want to avoid the because of continuity questions, but some are rather interesting. Explore cautiously, and with great restriction.
