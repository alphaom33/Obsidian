If a cord has a perfect 5<sup>th</sup>,8<sup>th</sup>,unison between any two voices, the next chord <ins>must not</ins> have a parallel 5<sup>th</sup>,8<sup>th</sup>,unison between the same 2 voices
Repeated notes never produce errors
Unequal 5<sup>th</sup>s: Diminished 5<sup>th</sup> between the bass and another voice may not move to a perfect 5<sup>th</sup> between the <ins>same two</ins> voices
Direct 5<sup>th</sup>,8<sup>th</sup>:
1. end with a perfect 5<sup>th</sup>,8<sup>th</sup> between <ins>bass and soprano</ins>
2. both voices moved in the same direction
3. Soprano moves by a leap (more than 1)
