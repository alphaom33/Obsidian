"Oh my goodness%%Matthew please%% you're actually here I'm so excited! Um, Kantiel. You?"
"..."%%I'd tag this if I had those but I don't, so this is what you're going to get okay%%
"Scaring the poor girl, aren't you? She's only just arrived. We're terrifying"
"It's... fine. My name is... (why are you pausing so much?) Virda"
"Hi... Virda (oh great they noticed). Tillian"
"Great, now that we've finished with names, Kantiel can commence asking the list of questions"
"I don't think I have a list?"
"Place of origin, occupation, mother's occupation, siblings, friends, father's occupation, leader, goals, manner of change." She sniffed, raising her chin in an overly haughty way%%"this kind of looks a lot like a tag," you say idiotically%%
"Fine. You do the questions then."
"Um, no. Tillian?"
"Who are you people?"
"I said Tillian was asking the questions now, actually."
"Didn't you *just* insult Kantiel for, quote, scaring the poor girl?"
"Girls, girls. Just let me talk. Virda," she began.%%doesn't mention a name so it doesn't count%% "Where are you from?"
"laughter%%shut up%%"
"A small village, near Larsosheem. It's a mage-feeder, so our crops are kind of spread thin. The trees, though..."
"What about the trees?" she leaned closer, suddenly even more interested than she was before
"They... their branches grow so high above, spreading in such great canopy. I love just standing under them, looking up at the infinite expanse of their enormity. Loved," %%I'm giving myself a pass here you don't need a reason why go away%%I corrected, remembering what they had done before my fall. Before I gained magic, if Ivmoshk%%he isn't even in this conversation I can use his name okay%% was to be believed. "I don't know how to feel about them, after..."
"Do you remember yours, Tilian?"
"My what?"
"Your Possession," a small smirk
"It was rather boring, actually. I was conversing with my *many* friends, when a strange light appeared before me. Upon its observation, I posed a quandary as to whether anyone else was experiencing the light's presence, before suddenly collapsing"
"Posed a quandary?" a larger smirk
"Perhaps you would better understand intelligent conversation if you hadn't been born in the literal backwoods"
"Well my Possession was interesting, at least. If you remember, I used to live at The Eye. I was sailing on one of my family's merchant vessels, bringing a shipment of fabric to home. Then, a storm. Now, storms on The Eye are effectively unheard of, so our preparation had entailed nothing but a single bailing bucket. The mast wasn't even rigged to come down! While the winds were raging about us, our hull was filling with water, and our demise was creeping ever closer, I spotted it. Above us, leading the way home, a trail of lights in the sky. Only I could see it, but the sailors were willing to trust anything at that point. The whole way home, I led by the lights, fighting to keep consciousness against a strange force pressing in on me, until, finally, we spotted the harbor. I'm told they carried my unconscious body through the streets, cheering and dancing at the triumph over what should have been our end."
