Where am I if not here? The world swirls around me, colors blooming from the fog of brilliant white like fireworks, shining, in the sky. Only darker, only deadly.  It wants us, the void. Navigation is nonfunctional now that it has entered the space, our computers unresponsive. its voice calls in my ear, *follow my will and you shall be spared*, it says. No one else seems to hear, but Aethrion, with his stunted wings and sharpened eyes, looks ready to crack. Days we have flown without break, as a single mistake could be our end. *Give me your crew and end this pointless fight, save your broken people*. If they knew the promises it has given, they would all surely defect. David’s broken arm, Inter’s raw claws, even Aethrion.
