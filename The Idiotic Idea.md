#poetry #contempt
A sea, punctuation abounds
There, rising, above the deep it stands.
Terrible, inhumane
Borrowed phrases, progress forever, memory erasure, needs a borrow
checker
World's own tongue, a great beast stands
back again, yet never again
Replacement; Propositions
Carbon, Zig, 
Golang, Rust
Yet unions and pointers
void not undefined
structs
I simply must believe
They Don't See
How beautiful it stands

This built upon all that which was before
The world around and made upon, it frowned
How modules when required closed the door
The journal brought words small; now Objects sound

Alone they reign beyond attempts against
Untouched, thus far failed, complex, so unknown
None brought can seem to shout their praise, yet, minced,
They stand still bright, still strong, still ingrained, shown

The world revolves around that which none can 

Imperative
Procedural
Object: defined
The worst and so it moves
Ever striving, away from that which is used
Towards what we always knew
was best
and yet
never reaching
**Functional**
(lisp never forgets)
